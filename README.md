This WordPress custom theme is a multilingual site in both English and Japanese. You can easily switch by clicking the buttons on the header.

The ability to pay with PayPal has also been implemented so that the customer can purchase a product directly via the website.

By using the plugin you can also book the online lessons. Each time the customer books the lesson then the email is sent to the site admin automatically.
